Not really interested in typology anymore, sorry. 
Bio ver: 1.3.2 - ik I'm being too optimistic by assuming someone is going to read this

OKAY I finally did it and actually made a GitHub Repository to store my bio's previous versions ( https://github.com/NotaProudPDBee/PDB-bio ), if anyone is interested (probably no one) they can dm me and I'd happily add their bio to the repository and add them as a contributor so they can update it whenever they want!

Why am I here even though I dislike typology? I used to like it, but now I'm just here for the community. (especially the Persian community, trust me you won't find people like this easily) 

My hobbies? sleeping is the main one tbh, reading books,  and I also like *a few* anime shows, my favorite one is Eighty-Six

the less human-related the science, the better it is. I dislike politics & sociology but sadly, considering the political situation in my country right now, I think have to read about both, meh. I also don't really like touching random people so medical science while interesting is a bit gross.
So what I DO like? sleeping. I love computer science and I'm planning to study it in uni, I have a great passion for mathematics and physics.

I often try to be nice but if I ever came off as rude, sorry.

I'm thankful that you've made it this far. You're probably my friend now! I'm glad I could talk to you! 

STOP tinder-ization of PDB
